# Cache Simulator Project

This project simulates a cache memory system with support for different replacement policies (LRU, FIFO, Random).

## Files
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook to run the simulator.
- `cache_simulator.py`: Contains the simulator class.
- `example_trace.txt`: Sample memory access trace.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run
1. Open `main.ipynb` in JupyterLab.
2. Run all cells.
3. See the cache hit/miss statistics.
